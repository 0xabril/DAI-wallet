# ethereum-wallet

This is an example of a simple Ethereum wallet that runs on web3 using the validation from MetaMask. It supports smart contracts of 3 different currencies including the Rinkeby test net DAI, MKR and USDC. The wallet also accesses ETH on the Rinkeby test net and has the functionality for sending and receiving tokens, as well as showing the most recent history and displaying the current balance.
